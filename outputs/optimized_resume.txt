EXPERIENCE
Research Volunteer,Iowa State University May 2025 – Present
● Designed and executed 80+ experiments on differential privacy and machine unlearning, identifying three
key failure points and sharing findings to fix the three biggest causes of crashes.
● Currently researching and implementing 20+ machine unlearning methods (e.g., SFTC, DP-SGD) using
Python, PyTorch,HuggingFace to analyze forget/retain behavior on CIFAR-10, MNIST, and GLUE datasets.
● responsiveness by 25% and cutting average user onboarding duration by 15 minutes.
Software Engineer intern, Skyscend India Private Limited October2023 – December 2023
● Boosted UI performance by 30% by refactoring into modules and refactoring key dashboard components
using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Chrome DevTools.
● Collaborated with UX designers and communicated validation requirements to improve form usability;
implemented rule-based checks and real-time feedback using JavaScript, HTML5, and regex, reducing
client-side errors by 60%.
● Collaborated with frontend and backend teams to streamline invoice data rendering by integrating RESTful
APIs with React state management using Axios, enhancing data sync accuracy by 40%.
P
UBLICATION
Design and implement an efficient fingerprint authentication algorithm using SHA-512
● Led the design of a fingerprint authentication system using SHA-512, MATLAB, and Verilog, reducing
spoofing vulnerabilities by 40% through iterative testing with the research team.
● Developed a real-time data ingestion pipeline with Apache Kafka and Spark Streaming, processing
5TB/day with 99.99% accuracy, cutting data loss by 40%.
● Implemented advanced feature extraction using ridge flow and Gabor filters in MATLAB, improving
fingerprint recognition accuracy and decreasing false rejection rate by 38%.
PROJECTS
Edge-Cloud Latency Optimization using IFogSim
● Reduced execution latency by 35% in cloud-to-edge workflows by implementing fog-first task scheduling
in iFogSim (Java).Automated multi-node deployments with 15+ reusable Ansible modules, cutting setup
time by 60%.
● Designed a secure, low-latency authentication system in Java handling 10,000 concurrent users with 2ms
response time, reducing failure rates by 15%.
AI-Powered Video Generation using Stable Diffusion
● Generated 12+ AI-driven videos from text prompts using Stable Diffusion v1.5, Deforum, and Hugging
Face Transformers in Python; improved frame coherence by 32% by tuning seed strength and noise steps.
● Reduced rendering time by 45% via XFormers optimization,GPU acceleration on Google Colab,batched
frame processing; automated the pipeline using Python and FFmpeg, cutting generation time by 75%.
Consent Lens
● Programmed a Chrome Extension using Vanilla JavaScript, MutationObserver, and the Performance API to
detect and classify third-party tracking elements across webpages in <150ms, improving user visibility into
pre-consent trackers.
● Consolidated tracker signals across 50+ real-world sites and built a responsive floating dashboard UI to
display detection results; codebase published on GitHub and structured with ES6 best practices.
